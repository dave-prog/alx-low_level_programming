### Requirements

- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Compiler: gcc
- Style guidelines: [Betty style] (https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)

### Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for Holberton School. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

### Concepts to be learned in this repository:
- What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
- What is malloc and free and how to use them
- Why and when use malloc
- How to use valgrind to check for memory leak

### Description of what each file shows:
- A function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char
- A function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter
- A function that concatenates two strings
- A function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers
- A function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function
- Afunction that concatenates all the arguments of your program
- A function that splits a string into words
